## Overview

This script is designed to integrate a webshop with Enfocus Switch, a powerful automation software for managing prepress workflows in the printing industry. Written in Node.js with TypeScript, the script supports both polling and webhook methods to facilitate seamless data exchange between the webshop and Enfocus Switch, enabling efficient order processing, file handling, and workflow automation.

## Key Features

1. **Order Retrieval**:

   - **Polling**: Periodically polls the webshop’s API to retrieve new orders.
   - **Webhook**: Receives order data via HTTP POST requests from the webshop when a new order is placed.

2. **File Download and Processing**:

   - Downloads files associated with each order.

3. **Metadata Extraction**:
   - Extracts relevant metadata from the order, such as customer details, order ID, and product specifications.
   - Embeds this metadata into the files for easy identification and processing within Enfocus Switch.

## Technical Details
